# ISO-8601

I agree with
[Randall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe).

When writing out dates as strings,
_please_ use the ISO-8601 format.
It has a sensible collation order,
and there's no ambiguity about which field is where.
(I lived through the Y2K nightmare,
and we still have a decade to go before 2031 is behind us.)

Filenames are a particularly good place to use this format,
as sort order tends to matter.

And no, I don't especially care if your Y-M-D h:m:s timestamp
has a spec-compliant capital "T" in the middle,
or some friendlier character like " " SPACE or "-" dash.

## zone offset

Additionally, notice that a stamp like this
is only meaningful if we have extra context:

    2021-12-18 23:59

There's at least twenty-four instants in time that corresponds to.

Consider tacking on the needed context with every timestamp,
using one of two approaches:

    2021-12-18 23:59Z
    2021-12-18 23:59+0000

Here is a very _different_ instant in time: `2021-12-18 23:59+0800`.

Avoid suffixes like "PST", as we can often find multiple
time zones throughout the world
which use same three letters for different offset.

## binary timestamp

When using typed storage of timestamps,
in memory, HDF5 binary file, postgres `timestamp` column, or similar,
_always_ use UTC, a zone offset of zero.

Almost always the right answer for storing a stamp is:
number of seconds since the epoch.
Typically that is midnight in Greenwich, 1970-01-01.

### internal representation

There are many good things to say about python's `datetime` module,
including its support for timedeltas.
But it has the somewhat regrettable concept of
[na√Øve vs. aware](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#aware-and-naive-objects)
timestamps.
Ignoring "aware" objects is certainly one feasible approach.

My advice?
Explicitly init each timestamp as aware, with a UTC zone offset.
Then the Right Thing is sure to happen,
it's nearly impossible to accidentally mix the two types of stamps.
