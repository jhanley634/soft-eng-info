# A small PR is a beautiful PR

![pull!](asset/2022-01-03/coxswain-pull-request.jpg)

Often we try to adhere to the
[Single-responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle).
It makes sense not only for functions and classes,
but also for pull requests.

A PR should try to do just one thing, and do it well.
Remind yourself of that thing by writing a single sentence
at top of PR which explains the goal, explains what
good thing a merge will produce.
If you need several sentences, consider splitting the PR.

Motivation for a PR will often look like "adds feature X",
"fixes bug Y", or "refactors by extracting helper".
These statements are promises, verifiable by a reviewer.

## mechanical transformations

Occasionally we want to touch lots of a files in some trivial way,
such as adjusting whitespace or running `isort`.
If you're already making some substantive edit to a file, like adding a method,
then it's fine to include such mechanical edits.
If there will be "many" such diffs accompanying your one-line change,
go to the trouble of creating two branches and sending two PRs.
Both will be easy to quickly read and quickly approve.

If a mechanical transformation touches a bunch of files that
lack other substantive edits, definitely do that refactor in a separate,
tightly focused PR. Again, it will be easy to read and approve.

Fixing lint errors, editing until `flake8` runs cleanly,
might not be a _strictly_ mechanical process.
But it is close enough, the same guidelines apply.

## a proof

Every essay, every math theorem, is an argument.
It tries to convince the reader of some proposition.

So, too, with a function or a class.
It claims to preserve or establish certain invariants,
and it claims the code is correct.

View a PR in the same way.
It makes claims about what will be true after a merge,
and we can verify those claims.
Sticking to single-responsibility for each PR
makes it easier to verify them.
