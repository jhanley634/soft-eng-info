# start with a test

When we write code,
it's a sure thing we're going to need to execute it.
After all, a line that never ran is probably a line that is buggy.
You can start with interactive runs from the command line,
perhaps with some debug `print()`s mixed in.
But there's another way to begin.

Start by writing an automated test that calls into your brand new code.
Use repeated execution to drive your edit -- debug cycle.

What just happened here?
You got your tests "for free"!

You're going to have to do this work anyway.
Might as well produced a checked-in document at the same time,
which you or teammates can run in the months to come.
Give it a try. I predict you'll like it.
